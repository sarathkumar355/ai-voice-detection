# JanSathi AI - Requirements Document

## Problem Statement
Many government welfare schemes in India do not reach eligible citizens due to lack of awareness, language barriers, complex application processes, and digital illiteracy. Existing platforms are text-heavy and difficult for rural and underserved communities to use.

## Target Users
- Rural and semi-urban citizens
- Students, farmers, job seekers
- Citizens with limited digital literacy
- Users with low internet connectivity

## Proposed Solution
JanSathi AI is a voice-first, multilingual AI assistant that helps citizens discover government schemes they are eligible for and guides them step by step through the application process.

## Functional Requirements
- The system should allow voice and text-based interaction
- The system should support local Indian languages
- The system should collect basic user details (age, income, location)
- The system should identify eligible government schemes
- The system should provide step-by-step application guidance
- The system should list required documents for each scheme

## Non-Functional Requirements
- The system should work in low-bandwidth environments
- The interface should be simple and mobile-friendly
- The system should provide clear and understandable responses

## Expected Impact
The solution aims to improve access to public services, reduce dependency on middlemen, and ensure government schemes reach the intended beneficiaries.
